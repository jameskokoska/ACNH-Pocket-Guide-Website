        <h2>App Data</h2>
        <h3>Importing/Exporting Data to Local Storage Permissions</h3>
        <p>
          The (Expo React Native) SDK we use and the implementation of exporting data requires the user to specify a local folder on their device. We use the latest Android library, meaning only the folder you specify the app will be able to write the file to.
          The importing of data requires the user to specify a local file on their device. The app will only read and only has access to this file.
          This ‘exporting/importing of data’ feature is completely optional to the user and does not need to be enabled/used at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app will not and should not ask for any other permissions to be granted. <br/>
          This application will function completely fine with no permissions, apart from importing/exporting data.
        </p>
        <h3>Stored Data</h3>
        <p>
          All data is stored locally, on device using the React Native Async Storage library which can be seen here: <br/><a href="https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage">https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The collected database can be cleared by going to<br/>
          Settings > Reset Data > Reset<br/>
          (this cannot be undone!)<br/>
          Or by clearing application data and cache in application settings of the users phone
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud backup</h3>
        <p>
          The username is stored using Firebase Real Time Database maintained and managed by Google. The password is encrypted and stored on Firebase. The data manager does not have access to password data. Email data is only used to verify users identity - the following is an example case. If a user forgets their password and wants to reset it, their email will be used to verify their identity and request a password change through their original email.
          Email data is not used otherwise apart from identity verification, logging in to access their respective data or uploading their respective data (manually or automatically - based on user settings). The email acts as a username and doesn't need verification when signing up.
        </p>
