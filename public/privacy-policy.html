        </div>

        <p>
          This privacy policy and terms of use applies to the <i>ACNH Pocket Guide</i> app and related services provided by
          <i>DapperAppDeveloper</i> ("we", "us", "our").
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          <b>By default, ACNH Pocket Guide runs using local, on-device storage.</b> We do not collect data from you unless
          you choose to use optional features that exports your data across a network connection (for example, <b>Cloud Backup</b>).
        </p>
        <p>
          When Cloud Backup is enabled and used, we collect and process limited data strictly to provide that backup service
          (described below). We do not sell or share your data and we do not use it for advertising.
        </p>

        <br />

        <br/>

        <h2>App Data</h2>

        <h3>Importing/Exporting Data to Local Storage Permissions</h3>
        <p>
          The (Expo React Native) SDK and the implementation of exporting data require the user to specify a local folder on
          their device. We use the latest Android library, meaning only the folder you specify the app will be able to write
          the file to. Importing data requires the user to specify a local file on their device. The app will only read and
          only has access to that selected file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Importing/exporting is optional. The app will not request any additional permissions beyond what is necessary for
          the features you choose to use.
        </p>

        <h3>Stored Data (On Device)</h3>
        <p>
          Your in-app data is stored locally on your device using the React Native Async Storage library:
          <br /><a href="https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage"
            >https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Local data can be cleared by going to:
          <br />
          Settings &gt; Reset Data &gt; Reset
          <br />
          (this cannot be undone)
          <br />
          Or by clearing application data and cache in your device settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Cloud Backup (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
          If you enable and use Cloud Backup, the app will collect and transmit data to provide that service. Cloud Backup is
          maintained using Google Firebase services.
        </p>

        <h4>What we collect/process for Cloud Backup</h4>
        <p>
          When Cloud Backup is used, we process and store:
          <br />
          • <b>Account identifiers</b> you provide (such as email/username) to create and access your backup account
          <br />
          • <b>Authentication data</b> (your password is encrypted; we do not store it in plaintext)
          <br />
          • <b>Backup content</b> (your ACNH Pocket Guide app data that you choose to upload, either manually or automatically
          based on your settings)
        </p>

        <h4>How we use Cloud Backup data</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud Backup data is used only to:
          <br />
          • authenticate you
          <br />
          • store and restore your backup content to your account
          <br />
          • support account recovery flows where applicable (for example, verifying identity for password reset)
        </p>

        <p>
          To learn more about Google Firebase’s privacy practices, see:
          <br /><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/</a>
        </p>

        <h4>Retention and deletion</h4>
        <p>
          Data stored via Cloud Backup may be deleted by the service provider if an account is inactive for an extended
          period. Data may also persist for a period of time unless you request removal or delete your account (where the
          feature is available).
          <br />
          More information can be found under <b>'Account Deletion'</b> of the FAQ page.
        </p>

        <h2>Diagnostics and Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>
          We do not run third-party crash reporting that collects and transmits your crash data as a
          service. If you contact support, you may choose to share information (such as screenshots or logs) to help diagnose
          issues.
        </p>

        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>
          By downloading, installing, or using this application, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but

        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the app or related services (including Cloud Backup) at any time.

          We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by the "Updated" date at the top of this
          document.
        </p>

        <h2>Catalog Scanner App</h2>
        <p>
          The Catalog Scanner application has separate behavior from ACNH Pocket Guide with respect to data processing and cloud backup services:
          <b>All scanning and recognition is processed on device and no data is collected by us for the Catalog Scanner app.</b>
          <b>The catalog scanner does not provide any cloud backup services, and therefore no data is transmitted off the device.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Catalog Scanner app does not transmit scanned images or recognized text to us. The app is fully functional
          without internet. When exporting to ACNH Pocket Guide, the clipboard is used and user interaction is required to
          transfer data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The catalog collection is stored locally on device using Flutter Shared Preferences:
          <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences">https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences</a>. This
          collection can be cleared within the application or by clearing application data and cache in device settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Catalog Scanner app requires the camera solely for scanning catalog entries. Google ML Kit is used for text
          recognition:
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit">https://developers.google.com/ml-kit</a>. ML Kit terms:
